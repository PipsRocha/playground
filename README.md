## Wonder workshop playground app
Welcome to wonder workshop playground app!  This is a sample application that integrates with wonder workshop's developer API to provide granular access to all the dash/dot sensors and actuators.  Feel free to modify the code here as needed to create your very own app that interacts with dash and dot in creative ways!

### How to get started
Please refer to our [developer portal](https://developer.makewonder.com/#/gettingstarted) for how to download our API framework binary and integrate it into your application.  This project also provides examples on how to discover/connect with robots, send commands to dash/dot, and register for robot events.  

### Communication
* If you **need help**, we have a vibrant [developer forum](https://devforum.makewonder.com/) community.  Also, [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is another good resource (Tag 'makewonder' or 'dashdot'). 
* If you **found a bug and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it**, please send an email to developers@makewonder.com with a description of the bug, repo steps, and any debugging output/stack trace that you have!
* If you **have a feature request**, please post your idea in our [developer forum - feature requests](https://devforum.makewonder.com/t/api-feedback-and-feature-requests/12/8) thread.
* If you **love what we are doing**, we are always looking for [awesome engineers](https://www.makewonder.com/careers) to help us change the way children learn how to program!
