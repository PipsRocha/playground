## Wonder workshop playground app
Welcome to wonder workshop playground app!  This is a sample application that integrates with wonder workshop's developer API to provide granular access to all the dash/dot sensors and actuators.  Feel free to modify the code here as needed to create your very own app that interacts with dash and dot in creative ways!

### How to get started
Please refer to our [developer portal](https://developer.makewonder.com/#/gettingstarted) for how to download our API framework binary and integrate it into your application.  This project also provides examples on how to discover/connect with robots, send commands to dash/dot, and register for robot events.
