### Developer Guidelines

We want to build a productive and happy developer community that grows and learns as we do. Our purpose is to help you make your mark on the world with amazing applications of Dash & Dot. 

We invite anyone to create any type of application, and we encourage you to dream up uses of the Wonder Workshop platform that we never thought of. The following guidelines exist to ensure a safe and positive ecosystem for everyone. 

### Your application should be:

#### Squeaky clean

Keep it PG - no explicit content, offensive language, or violent material. Content on your application should be appropriate for children of all ages.

#### Respectful to all robots, puppies, and people

Wonder Workshop robots abide by the Three Laws of Robotics. The robots shall not cause harm to others, shall obey orders given to them by humans, and shall protect their own existence. 

#### Rightfully yours

Using songs, graphics, or photographs? You should have the rights to publish all content on your application. 

#### Free of bugs 

Everything should be ready to go and working. We know bugs inevitably sneak into applications, and we will tell you if we find any! You should do your best to stay on top of any bug reports. 

#### Easy to understand and use 

Your application should be accessible to most people and intuitive to use. No applications in Wingdings, please! 

#### Ad free 

We want you to make money off your application while ensuring a good user experience. Instead of ads, we encourage you to make a paid application. Weâ€™ll even help you get your first customers and reviews! 

#### Review Process 

Your application can be accessed by up to 5 devices for development and test purposes until you become Wonder Workshop Verified. All applications must meet the above criteria to be widely distributed through the App Store or Google Play. 

Getting verified is easy. Just [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/a/play-i.com/forms/d/1vYSGzujCT21I-RWaPmiXAAyuWYLBld1QXwNePA6BmRQ/viewform) and invite [developers@makewonder.com](mailto:developers@makewonder.com) to your [TestFlight](http://www.testflightapp.com/) account.
