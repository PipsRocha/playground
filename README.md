# Sample play-i API application
This sample application performs simple tasks for Bo/Yana through the play-i developer API. Specifically, this app demonstrates the following:
* How the play-i API is being used in iOS
* How to use the API to command Bo/Yana (currently works with our developer simulator)

We will continue to update this application in the future to outline API capabilities.

Please refer to our developer forum (http://devforum.play-i.com/) for support.
